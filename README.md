# Messenger-By-Dvir

Instant messaging responsive website written over HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end and JavaScript for the
back-end using [socket.io](https://socket.io) for the Server-Client Communication.


# Initialization 

First of all make sure you installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your system.
For the local inspection of the website, I used [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server):

    npm install --global http-server

In your server directory install [socket.io](https://socket.io):

    npm install socket.io

To activate your http-server use the following code on your working directory (where index.html located):

    http-server -c-1

Activate the server using the following code on the server\server.js:

    node server.js

Visit the website within your local network on http://localhost:8080/.
You may open the website in a few tabs and/or on your mobile phone and watch the website in action.
